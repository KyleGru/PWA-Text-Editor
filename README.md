## Description
This application is a simple text editor that can run in a browser as well as a local app on your machine. It has the capability of saving text typed into the editor to the local storage as well as the indexedDb. This allows the user to be disconnected from online services and still operate the app because of the cached data saved to the database as well. 

Here is the link to the deployed application on Render: https://pwa-text-editor-z2ej.onrender.com

## Installation

### Local
- Clone this repository and create a new workspace in VS code.
- Open up the PWA-text-Editor in the terminal and run `npm install` and then `npm run start` 
- From here you should be able to open the app from port 3000 by typing `localhost:3000` in the browser.

### Render

- Go to https://pwa-text-editor-z2ej.onrender.com
- From here you may also click the install button to install the app on your computer.

## Usage
To see this app in action just add any text or code and click out of the text area to have the app save what you have typed in. When you hit refresh you'll see that what you added will still be saved to the text area. If you open the dev tools in the browser and open the application tab and go to service workers you can click offline to see that the app will still run offline.
